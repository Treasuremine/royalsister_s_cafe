A business goal is a desired outcome that a company wants to achieve within a specific time frame. Business goals can be broad and long term or specific and short term. They help to motivate teams, measure progress, and improve performance.

Some examples of business goals are:

- **Boost employee morale by 30% over the next six months**
- **Improve overall interviewing practices by implementing a streamlined interview process for each candidate**
- **Reduce employee costs by 20% over the next year**
- **Increase total customer base by 15% over the next six months**
- **Assess previous marketing and sales tactics to determine the most effective strategies and implement those for the next fiscal year**
- **Increase shareholder value**
- **Develop a new product or service**
- **Improve product or service quality**
- **Achieve higher on-time delivery**
- **Increase customer satisfaction**

To set business goals, you can use different frameworks such as SMART, OKR, MBO, BHAG, or KRA. These frameworks help you to define your goals in a clear, measurable, and achievable way. They also help you to track your progress and adjust your objectives if needed.

For example, if you want to set a business goal using the SMART framework, you need to make sure that your goal is:

- **Specific**: clearly state what you want to accomplish, who is involved, where it will happen, and why it is important.
- **Measurable**: define how you will measure your success and track your progress.
- **Achievable**: ensure that your goal is realistic and attainable with the resources and time available.
- **Relevant**: align your goal with your company's mission, vision, and values.
- **Time-bound**: set a deadline or a timeframe for your goal.

An example of a SMART business goal is:

- **Increase sales revenue by 10% in the first quarter of 2023 by launching a new marketing campaign and offering discounts to loyal customers.**
